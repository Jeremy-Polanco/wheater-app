## Overview

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85263988/160262539-2fd3766d-bc80-4c25-a4fb-7482778cff72.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  You can find the demo at https://weather-app-2b3442.netlify.app/.
- What was your experience?
  This proyect is perfect to practice developing web apps using an api, looping through lists, and conditional rendering.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I improved my knowledge about api's such as geolocation and metaweather, and also I gained experience in react
- Your wisdom? 
  Something that I notice was that if you are using conditional rendering that uses the data you are going to fetch from an api, and you're using useState hook since
  It's asyncronous you can run into some issues, but you can set and if statement to check when the state has some value.

### Built With
